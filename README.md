# Dog-Cat-classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for precise classification of dog and cat images. The classification model is seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing for effortless interaction and demonstration. Additionally, Ngrok is utilized to expose the locally hosted Streamlit application to the internet, enabling easy access for sharing and demonstration purposes without the need for remote server deployment.

## Features
**CNN Image Classification**: Utilizes CNNs to accurately differentiate between dog and cat images, extracting intricate features for precise classification.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Streamlit, the application provides a seamless and intuitive interface for users to interact with the classification model effortlessly.

**Internet Access with Ngrok**: Ngrok is implemented to expose the locally hosted Streamlit application to the internet, allowing for easy sharing and demonstration without deploying to a remote server.

## Usage
**Upload Images**: Users can upload dog or cat images using the provided interface.

**Image Classification**: Upon upload, the CNN model classifies the uploaded images as either a dog or a cat.

**View Results**: The application displays the classification results along with the uploaded images for users to review.

## Technologies Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

**Streamlit**: Python library for building web applications.

**Ngrok**: Tool for exposing locally hosted applications to the internet.
